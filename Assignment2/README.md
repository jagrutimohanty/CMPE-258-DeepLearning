### Assignment 2 : Used Google cloud platform using my personal email id (jagruti.iter@gmail.com) for getting free credits to do the assingment.

#### Steps followed : 
 *1. Created a project and tagged it for billing.
 *2. For individual tasks did the following :
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Part 1 - 1.a 
                             *Built image classification model - This is an coconut and banana tree classifier model single label binary classification                                        model.
                             *Downloaded google images using chrome extension imageeye and added them into two separate folders. The folder names were the class                               labels for prediction task.Choose the cloud hosted model for online prediction task.Training of model took sometime and then                                    notfied via email 
                              * Once the model was trained.Precision 96.15% and recall of 96.15% of the model.
                              * Used Vision for this task.
                              * Uploaded a test image and the classifer prediction results are accurate and shown in the pdf.
Part 1 - 1.b
                              Build text classification model -
                              *Text classification model for this have taken a kaggle dataset which had corona related tweets in the form of text and labelled                                    as very positive , positive , neutral , negative and very negative. 
                              *The training data I uploaded into the storage bucket and tagged the dataset to the data storage.After training the model precision                               was 64.31% and recall was 63.93%.
                              *In the test and use tab I wrote few sentences and clicked the predict button and the prediction model was accurately able to                                     predict.
                                    

Part 1 1.c
                              Build video classification model 
                                 * For this I build a video classifer which predicts that the video clip is of work from home or is it work from office video. 
                                 * I took downloaded data from https://www.pexels.com/ site the video clips and created two sets of folders and uploaded the data                                   in buckets with a reference csv of the storage path. 
                                 *After uploading the training data in respective label folders - workfromhome and workfromoffice trained the model for                                             prediction. For testing the output I uploaded a video and the prediciton results are shown in the pdf screeenshot.                                  
                              
                              
                              
 Part 1.d 
                                 * Build structured data model for regression prediction task
                                 *For this I choose a mobile price prediction dataset from kaggle and this had prices of mobile phones based on the features                                        attributes. Trained the classifier after uploading the data into bucket and showed the test use demo for the task.


Part 1.e
                                  Build custom image recognition model for vegetables to recognize the image of beetroot,carrrot and potaoes.
                                  For this picked random images of the 3 vegetables and used edge to create a model in tensorflow lite downloadable format.
                                  Deployed it on andriod application
                              
                              
Part 2-  2.a
                                  Timeseries using bigquery and the completed the tutorial given in the assignment
                                  For this assignment followed the tutorial link given and performed the timeseries analysis on riderdataset.
Part 2.b 
                                 Build andriod application with the custom image recognition model created.
                                 Build a applicaiton named myapplicaiton for vegetable image classier. This application features were to upload the image and                                     then click the predict button to predict and show if it was potato , beetroot or carrot. 
                                 The training data was from google images. Using andriod studio kotlin language deployed the tensorflow lite model. This had an                                  UI part and one backend part to be designed and coded. The details are shown in the pdf.
                                 
                                 
I have uploaded the datasets used for training and few screenrecordings and all of the screenshots taken in google drive.
