#### Updated Google colab notebook by using Fastai and came up with the following implementations 
```
* Prediction a pciture uploaded is a dog pciture by using a predefined fastai function and adding a upload widget
* Worked on data augmentation 
* Worked with the data segmentation using images and object segmentation in images 
* Worked with the text dataset to find the text classification 
* Importing a tabular dataset by loading a csv into dataframe which is different than the default dataset provided by fastai 
* Created a prediction model to check the survivors of the the titanic ship wreck based on the features
